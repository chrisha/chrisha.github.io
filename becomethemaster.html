   	  <h2>
   	  	<p>I designed an instruction board teaching people how to make an origami butterfly. I took photographs of different steps in the progress of folding the butterfly, and used Photoshop to add guidelines to the pictures.  </p>

      <br>
      <p>After the testing section, one out of three testers succeeded making the object following the instruction I designed. Despite the bias about age, personal interests and references of the testers, I concluded that my design works, even though the presentation is not yet friendly and compelling to the users. </p>
